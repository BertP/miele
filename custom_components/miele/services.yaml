  # If the service accepts entity IDs, target allows the user to specify entities by entity, device, or area.
  # If `target` is specified, `entity_id` should not be defined in the `fields` map.
  # By default it shows only targets matching entities from the same domain as the service,
  # but if further customization is required, target supports the entity, device, and area selectors (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/).
  # Entity selector parameters will automatically be applied to device and area, and device selector parameters will automatically be applied to area.
